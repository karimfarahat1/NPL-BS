# Overview

An implementation of the main algorithm is contained within the NPL-BS.cpp file. It has been designed with an R interface and C++ backend through use of Rcpp [1]. 
An explanation of its mechanics can be found in Chapter 6 of the document contained within the Thesis subfolder. 


While less interest was taken in its development throughout the course of the project, code used to create simulation studies can be found in the utilities.R file for reproducibility.
